# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project leverages machine learning to predict wine quality based on various physicochemical properties. It was developed as part of an academic assignment to explore data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques using a real-world dataset.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Wine Quality dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes the following physicochemical attributes:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (score from 0 to 10)

## 🧠 Models Used

The following machine learning models were trained and compared:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBoost (optional)

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate model performance, the following metrics were used:

- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Mean Squared Error (for regression tasks)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to:

- Understand data distributions
- Handle missing values
- Normalize and scale features
- Visualize correlations using heatmaps and pair plots
