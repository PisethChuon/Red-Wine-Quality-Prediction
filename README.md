# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project leverages machine learning to predict wine quality based on various physicochemical properties. It was developed as part of an academic assignment to explore data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques using a real-world dataset.

# Understanding the different features of wine quality parameter

- **Fixed Acidity:** are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate readily
- **Volatile Acidity:** are high acetic acid in wine which leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste
- **Citric Acid**: acts as a preservative to increase acidity. When in small quantities, adds freshness and flavor to wines
- **Residual Sugar:** is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. The key is to have a perfect balance between sweetness and sourness. It is important to note that wines > 45g/ltrs are sweet
- **Chlorides:** the amount of salt in the wine
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide:** it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide:** is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2
- **Density:** sweeter wines have a higher density
- **pH:** describes the level of acidity on a scale of 0–14. Most wines are always between 3–4 on the pH scale
- **Alcohol:** available in small quantities in wines makes the drinkers sociable
- **Sulphates:** a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
- **Quality:** which is the output variable/predictor

## 📊 Dataset
